# PRODIGY_BW_05: Hotel Booking Platform: Backend API (Mini Project)

This is Task 5 of my backend web development internship with Prodigy Infotech.

In this task, I developed a fully functional backend API for a hotel booking platform. It includes user authentication, room listing, room search, and booking functionality, all powered by a PostgreSQL database and Prisma ORM.

## What This Project Does

- Allows users to register and log in securely using JWT
- Lets authenticated users create and manage hotel room listings
- Supports searching and filtering rooms by location, date, and price
- Enables users to book available rooms for specific date ranges
- Implements relational data management using PostgreSQL and Prisma

## Why Build This?

This mini project combines everything from the previous tasks( authentication, database operations, route protection, and filtering logic) into one complete backend service, simulating a real-world system like Airbnb.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js + Express
- PostgreSQL + Prisma
- bcryptjs (for password hashing)
- jsonwebtoken (JWT authentication)
- dotenv (for environment configuration)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
